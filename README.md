# EasyA

Easy A was supposed to be a website that would help students organize their academic life. It was supposed to help students keep up with their assignments by providing a calendar that would color code each course along with their assignments. Easy A was the group project's idea, but since the group was reduced to one group member, I had to improvise and change the project to a Tetris game. Tetris is a very popular game that is played by preventing the color blocks that come in different shapes to reach the top. Once the screen is full with the blocks, it's game over for the player.
